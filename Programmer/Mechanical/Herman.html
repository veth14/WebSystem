                <span class="bios"> Biography </span> <br> Herman Hollerith, (born February 29, 1860, Buffalo, New York, U.S.â€”died November 17, 1929, Washington, D.C.), American inventor of a tabulating machine that was an important precursor of the electronic computer.

                Immediately after graduation from the Columbia University School of Mines in 1879, Hollerith became an assistant to his teacher William P. Trowbridge in the U.S. census of 1880. During the next decade he taught briefly at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge; experimented on air brakes; and worked for the Patent Office in Washington, D.C. <br> <br>

                <span class="bios"> Early Life </span> <br> Herman Hollerith was born to German immigrants in Buffalo, NY in 1860. His early education was rocky, but he was eventually able to enroll at the City College of New York in 1875. He graduated from the Columbia University School of Mines in 1879, impressing one of his professors, W.P. Trowbridge, so much that the man asked Hollerith to become his assistant.
                Hollerith followed Trowbridge to the 1880 census, where he worked as a statistician. It was from his experiences during the processing of that census that Hollerith realized the need for a better way to count results. Billings suggested a device similar to the Jacquard loom, an automatic weaving machine that is controlled by specially coded punch cards, might be used to automate the count.

                A tabulating machine would read one card at the moment, print bits of the card (fields) on fan-fold paper, rearrange them, and add one or more numbers punched on the card to one or more accumulators. To get totals on early models, the accumulator register dials were manually read after a card run. Later models could directly print totals. In addition, cards with a particular punch could be used as master cards, resulting in varied outcomes.

                <br> <br>Customer master cards, for example, could be combined with sorted cards that track specific purchases. The billing address and customer number would be printed from the master card when the tabulating machine reads it to make invoices, followed by individual items purchased and prices. Finally, the total price would be printed from the accumulator and the page ejected to the top of the next page, typically using carriage control tape when the next master card was recognized.
