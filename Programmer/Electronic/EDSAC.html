                <span class="bios"> Biography </span> <br> <br> Sir Maurice V. Wilkes, in full Sir Maurice Vincent Wilkes, (born June 26, 1913, Dudley, Worcestershire, Eng.—died Nov. 29, 2010, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire), British computer science pioneer. He helped build the first full-size stored-program computer (EDSAC, 1949), invented microprogramming (1951), cowrote the first book on computer programming (1951), wrote the first paper on cache memories (1965), and pioneered client-server architecture computing (1975). He won the Turing Award in 1967 and the Kyoto Prize in 1992. In 1995 he published Memoirs of a Computer Pioneer.
              <br> <br> <span class="bios"> Early Life </span> <br> Wilkes became interested in electronics as a boy and studied that subject in his spare time while working toward a degree in mathematics (1934) at St. John’s College, Cambridge. He then did graduate work at the university’s Cavendish Laboratory (M.A., 1936; Ph.D., 1937). His interest in computing was sparked in 1936 by a lecture by English physicist and computer pioneer Douglas Hartree. In 1937 the Mathematical Laboratory, which used mechanical computers for scientific projects, was founded at Cambridge. Wilkes was appointed university demonstrator there and was the Mathematical Laboratory’s only staff member.

                <span class="bios"> Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator </span> <br> <br> The Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) was a pioneering early computer designed and constructed at the University of Cambridge in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Developed under the leadership of Sir Maurice Wilkes, EDSAC featured several key innovations. One of its notable contributions was the utilization of mercury delay lines for memory, a technology that allowed data to be stored in acoustic waves circulating through tubes of mercury. EDSAC employed a binary system and was capable of executing a set of instructions from its stored program, a concept inspired by the earlier work on the Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer (EDVAC).
                <br> <br>EDSAC, the first full-size stored-program computer, built at the University of Cambridge, Eng., by Maurice Wilkes and others to provide a formal computing service for users. EDSAC was built according to the von Neumann machine principles enunciated by the Hungarian American scientist John von Neumann and, like the Manchester Mark I, became operational in 1949. Wilkes built the machine chiefly to study computer programming issues, which he realized would become as important as the hardware details.
