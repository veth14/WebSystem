                <span class="bios"> Biography </span> <br> <br> Alan Turing, (born June 23, 1912, London, Eng.—died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), English mathematician and logician. He studied at the University of Cambridge and at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study. In his seminal 1936 paper “On Computable Numbers,” he proved that there cannot exist any universal algorithmic method of determining truth in mathematics and that mathematics will always contain undecidable (as opposed to unknown) propositions. That paper also introduced the Turing machine. He believed that computers eventually would be capable of thought indistinguishable from that of a human and proposed a simple test (see Turing test) to assess this capability.
              <br> <br> <span class="bios"> Early Life </span> <br> His papers on the subject are widely acknowledged as the foundation of research in artificial intelligence. He did valuable work in cryptography during World War II, playing an important role in breaking the Enigma code used by Germany for radio communications. After the war he taught at the University of Manchester and began work on what is now known as artificial intelligence. In the midst of this groundbreaking work, Turing was found dead in his bed, poisoned by cyanide. His death followed his arrest for a homosexual act (then a crime) and sentence of 12 months of hormone “therapy.”

                <span class="bios"> Manchester Mark 1 </span> <br> <br> The Manchester Mark 1, also known as the Manchester Automatic Digital Machine (MADAM), was an early stored-program computer developed at the University of Manchester in the late 1940s. Built under the leadership of Frederic C. Williams and Tom Kilburn, the Manchester Mark 1 was notable for several pioneering features. It employed a Williams-Kilburn tube, the first-ever working example of random-access memory (RAM), allowing both data and instructions to be stored in the same memory unit. This architecture laid the groundwork for modern computers and contrasted with earlier machines that required rewiring for each new computation. The Manchester Mark 1 was also the first computer to successfully run a stored program, executing instructions stored in its memory, and it played a crucial role in advancing the understanding of computer architecture and programming techniques.
                <br> <br>Additionally, the Manchester Mark 1 featured a fixed-point arithmetic unit, facilitating numerical calculations with a high degree of precision. The machine's ability to perform floating-point arithmetic later became a standard capability in subsequent computer architectures.
