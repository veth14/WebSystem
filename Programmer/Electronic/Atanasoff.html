                <span class="bios"> Biography </span> <br> <br> Lee de Forest, (born August 26, 1873, Council Bluffs, Iowa, U.S.—died June 30, 1961, Hollywood, California), American inventor of the Audion vacuum tube, which made possible live radio broadcasting and became the key component of all radio, telephone, radar, television, and computer systems before the invention of the transistor in 1947. Although de Forest was bitter over the financial exploitation of his inventions by others, he was widely honoured as the “father of radio” and the “grandfather of television.” He was supported strongly but unsuccessfully for the Nobel Prize for Physics.

              <br> <br> <span class="bios"> Early Life </span> <br> <br> De Forest was the son of a Congregational minister. His father moved the family to Alabama and there assumed the presidency of the nearly bankrupt Talladega College for Negroes. Ostracized by citizens of the white community who resented his father’s efforts to educate blacks, Lee made his friends from among the black children of the town and, together with his brother and sister, spent a happy although sternly disciplined childhood in this rural community.

            <span class="bios"> Atanasoff-Berry Computer </span> <br> <br> Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC), an early digital computer. It was generally believed that the first electronic digital computers were the Colossus, built in England in 1943, and the ENIAC, built in the United States in 1945. However, the first special-purpose electronic computer may actually have been invented by John Vincent Atanasoff, a physicist and mathematician at Iowa State College (now Iowa State University), during 1937–42. (Atanasoff also claimed to have invented the term analog computer to describe machines such as Vannevar Bush’s Differential Analyzer.) 
            <br><br> Together with his graduate assistant Clifford E. Berry, Atanasoff built a successful small prototype in 1939 for the purpose of testing two ideas central to his design: capacitors to store data in binary form and electronic logic circuits to perform addition and subtraction. They then began the design and construction of a larger, more general-purpose computer, known as the Atanasoff-Berry Computer or the ABC.
